# Express.js Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that attempts to create a user.  However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios like malformed request bodies or database errors.  This leads to unhelpful error messages for clients and makes debugging difficult.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, demonstrating best practices.

**Key Improvements in the Solution:**

* **Input Validation:** Checks if the request body contains the necessary data.
* **Specific Error Handling:** Catches specific errors and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages.
* **Detailed Logging:** Logs errors with context for easier debugging.
* **Error Responses with Details:** Returns detailed error messages to the client (without revealing sensitive server information).
